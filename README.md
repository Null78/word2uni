# word2uni
a small php library to fix writing Arabic text on images with GD

# Author
Original code written by Abd Allatif Eymsh, fixed and updated by me :).

# Notes
- you may need to edit the hex code of some letters depending on the font you are using.
- you may face some proplems with unusual words.
- the font path could be different on linux or macOS (the current example is for windows).
- the recommended way is to use the ```text2uni``` function becuase it will handle multi words text and the english words.
- ```word2uni``` function takes one word only.
